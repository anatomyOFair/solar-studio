  sun: 'The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star at the center of our solar system. It contains 99.86% of the system\'s total mass and drives all planetary weather and climate through its radiation.',
  mercury: 'Mercury is the smallest and closest planet to the Sun. Despite its proximity, it has extreme temperature swings — from 430 °C during the day to −180 °C at night due to its lack of atmosphere.',
  venus: 'Venus is Earth\'s closest neighbour and similar in size, but its thick CO\u2082 atmosphere creates a runaway greenhouse effect with surface temperatures of 465 °C — hotter than Mercury.',
  earth: 'Earth is the only known planet to harbour life. Its liquid water, magnetic field, and nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere create the conditions that make complex life possible.',
  mars: 'Mars, the Red Planet, has the tallest volcano (Olympus Mons) and deepest canyon (Valles Marineris) in the solar system. Evidence of ancient river valleys suggests it once had flowing water.',
  jupiter: 'Jupiter is a gas giant and the largest planet in our solar system — over 1,300 Earths could fit inside it. Its Great Red Spot is a storm larger than Earth that has raged for centuries.',
  saturn: 'Saturn is famous for its spectacular ring system made of ice and rock particles. Despite being the second-largest planet, it\'s the least dense — it would float in a bathtub large enough.',
  uranus: 'Uranus rotates on its side with an axial tilt of 98°, likely from an ancient collision. It\'s an ice giant with a blue-green colour from methane in its atmosphere.',
  neptune: 'Neptune is the most distant planet and has the fastest winds in the solar system, reaching 2,100 km/h. Its deep blue colour comes from methane absorbing red light.',
  moon: 'The Moon is Earth\'s only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the solar system. Its gravitational pull drives Earth\'s tides and stabilises the planet\'s axial tilt.',
  titan: 'Titan is Saturn\'s largest moon and the only moon with a dense atmosphere. It has liquid methane lakes on its surface and is considered a candidate for extraterrestrial life.',
  ganymede: 'Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system — bigger than Mercury. It\'s the only moon known to have its own magnetic field and may harbour a subsurface ocean.',
  europa: 'Europa\'s icy surface hides a global saltwater ocean beneath, making it one of the most promising places to search for extraterrestrial life in our solar system.',
